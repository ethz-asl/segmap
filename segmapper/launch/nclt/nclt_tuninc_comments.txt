Config 0:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 60000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.2
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall bad. 	Don't have certain large clusters and facades.

Config 1:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 60000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.15*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: More segments. Probably, with 0.2 the segments were getting too large and got discarded

Config 2:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 120000*,
	radius_for_growing: 0.2*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall bad. Seems to have more segments. But also creating very large clusters (several trees) or large building facades

Config 3:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 100000*,
	radius_for_growing: 0.2
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall bad. Some nice tree segments are discared while large clusters with high variance are kept (not good).

Config 4:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 100000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.3*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Very bad. Ground removal is not perfect, sparse set of ground points still left as residues -> if grow radius too big, they are included as segments... Furthermore, forests clump together and get discarded...

Config 5:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 140000*,
	radius_for_growing: 0.3
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Ground plane residuals still a problem, need to reduce growing radius again. Cluster size nice, creates nice building facaded. Might need non-geometric clustering when tree close to bldg.

Config 6:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 140000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.2*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Still some ground residues, but less. In general ok, except for some forests clustering. Again, non-geometrics clustering might help for tree/bldg issue.

Config 7:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 140000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.15*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Still ground residues :( Other than that pretty good clustering of forests and even trees close to buildings. However, some clusters disappeared (bldg facades and large trees...)

Config 8:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 100000*,
	radius_for_growing: 0.15
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall good! One residue just won't go away. Other than that, pretty nice! Reducing cluster size helped for some reason. Why? But bldg facades aren't that nice anymore... 
Not sure how different 8 is from 7, need to check screencast..

Config 9:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 100000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.17
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall good. Better with facades! But could still improve. Rest equally good. But now, trees close to bldg connect again :( Might be able to resolve with non-geometric clustering..

Config 10:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 100000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.19*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall, bad (worse than 9). Even though some facades got bigger. Trees are clumping together, large trees and facades disappeared.

Config 11:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 150000*,
	radius_for_growing: 0.19
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall bad. Getting larger facades, but very large tree clusters and bldg/tree connectiong.

--------------------
Intermediate anlysis: Make radius smaller again so we don't get huge forests/bushes. Hope for semantic segmenter that trees/bldgs don't connect.

Config 12:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 150000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.18*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Overall good. Large facades and trees. Some bad tree clustering, but ok. Hope now for semantic segmenter to disconnect trees from bldgs.

!Compare to config1 (The best so far)
=> Config 12 > Config 1: Less issues with the large forests. But less segments in general. Keep tuning based on 12...

[BEST] Config 13:
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 150000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.17*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: So far the best :) Getting better with large forests.

Config 14
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 150000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.16*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Not much difference.

Config 15: 
	min_cluster_size: 400, 
	max_cluster_size: 150000,
	radius_for_growing: 0.15*
	clustering: geometric

Analysis: Better separation of forests. However, allows for veery large bushes which stay alive because they don't get large enough to be discarded.

==> Use config 13 with semantic segmentation!
